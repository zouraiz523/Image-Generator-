Welcome to the Image Generator App! This application allows you to generate images based on your input text using the Unsplash API. It's a web application that leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with styling from Bootstrap, to create an interactive user interface.

Usage
Once the application is open in your web browser, you will see a text input field and a button labeled "Generate Images."

Click the "Generate Images" button to fetch and display images from Unsplash based on your input.
